- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabrielmalaspina
- 👀 I’m interested in the C Programming Language and Electronics; where software meets hardware.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, (experimenting), with some mathematical abstractions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I am able to understand. I am a newbie so that's probably not very broad.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I still need to figure this out.
