  The whole idea behind creating these repos doesn't rely on its usefulness. Rather, what drives me is the need of progression and learning.
Surely, there are out there many other sources that offer better/more code, abstractions and algorithms, -I'm a newbie after all-, but this is for me.
To find out what I am capable of, to improve, and to help somebody if any he/she happens to find it useful in the meantime.
  Thanks for reading,

  Gabriel Malaspina.
